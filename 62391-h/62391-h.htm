<h1>LITTLE SUSAN<br />
<span class="smaller">AND</span><br />
HER LAMB.</h1>

<p>One fine summer’s morning, little
Susan’s mother called her to come
and have her breakfast. She took
her porringer, and sat down on a
green bank near the cottage door to
eat the bread and milk she had that
morning, and liked it very much,
as she did not always have milk for
breakfast. While Susan was eating
her breakfast, she thought about
a very pretty book, which had been
given her the week before as a reward
for her regular attendance at
the Sunday School, during the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
half year; for it had pleased God
that she should enjoy good health,
and Susan knew too well the value
of what she learned at the Sunday
school, ever to be absent when she
could attend. I never heard of her
playing about on a Sunday with
rude idle children, she knew that
would be breaking the Sabbath, and
she desired to keep it holy. Which
children do you think are the happiest,
those who play about, and get
into mischief on a Sunday, or those
good children who attend public
worship and endeavour to keep holy
the Sabbath day?</p>

<p>While Susan was eating her
breakfast, she thought about her reward
book, as I told you—it was
“Little Jane, the <span class="smcap">Young Cottager</span>,”
and she wished that she
might love the Saviour and be happy
like “Little Jane.”</p>

<p>When she had nearly finished her
porringer, a man came by driving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
some sheep, which he was going to
sell at the next town. Several of
the sheep had little lambs with them,
and some of these poor little creatures
were so tired that they could
hardly walk. One little lamb laid
down just as it came to the place
where Susan was sitting. The man
tried to make it get up, but it could
not rise, and seemed to be dying.
“Well,” said he, “I’ll have your
skin at any rate.” So saying, he was
about to tie its legs together, and
take it upon his shoulder, when
Susan spoke to him, and begged
very hard that he would leave the
little lamb with her, and she would
nurse it. “Why, as for that,” said
the man, “I suppose I might as
well give it you at once, for I don’t
reckon you can make much hand of
it; and I think I’ll e’en give it to
you, for now I recollect, you are the
little girl who ran after me over the
common last summer, and told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of the boys who had driven two of
my best sheep down yonder lane; I
should not have found them again
in a hurry, if it had not been for
you. Well, if you like to have the
lamb, take it and much good may
it do you.”</p>

<p>He then called his dog, and drove
his sheep on. Susan thanked him;
she put down her porringer, and
took up the lamb, and began to think
what she should do with it: its eyes
were shut, and it seemed dying.
“Well,” said she, “it is no great
matter to you, for I suppose they
would have killed you to-morrow
or next day, but I should have liked
you to have lived and played with
me. I would have tried to be kind
to you, for the Bible says, we are
to be merciful to poor dumb creatures
like you. God made you, as
well as me, and I recollect it is
written, ‘that his tender mercies
are over all his works.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>While she was talking in this
manner, the lamb opened its eyes a
little way, and gave a faint bleat.
Susan was delighted. “Poor little
thing, perhaps you are hungry,” said
she, and taking her spoon, she put
a little of the milk into its mouth,
and to her great joy saw that it was
swallowed. Susan then gave the
lamb some more, and wrapped it
up closer in her apron. It soon revived
with the warmth, and presently
was able to stand, it then
went to the porringer and drank the
rest of Susan’s breakfast; you may
be sure she did not grudge it.</p>

<p>Susan now went to her mother,
and told all that had happened, and
showed her the little lamb. Her mother
said she might put it upon the
grass-plot behind the cottage. The
little girl did so, and before night
it was quite well again.</p>

<p>Susan had to go every day to
work, but you may be sure she did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
not neglect her little lamb; every
morning when she had her own
breakfast, she went and fed it very
carefully;—and the lamb was always
ready to come as soon as it
heard her little mistress call.</p>

<p>Do not you think Susan felt very
happy when she looked at the
little lamb? She had been kind to
it, and felt much more pleased than
if she had not taken any care about
it. I have known little boys, and
girls too, who have taken pleasure
in teazing poor animals, but I have
always remarked that they were
bad children. Those who can take
pleasure in killing flies, or hurting
dumb creatures, would delight in
tormenting their brothers and sisters,
or companions, if they dared
to do so; and when they grow up
to be men and women, unless their
evil habits are broken off, they will
prove to be wicked people. Our
hearts are naturally inclined to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
what is evil, and will always take
pleasure therein, if they are not
changed by divine grace. This is
what Jesus told Nicodemus, as you
may read in the third chapter of
Saint John. Little Susan had been
taught this. She felt that it was
true, and prayed to God to give her
a new heart. She prayed that she
might love Christ and believe in him.
Christ has said that those who ask
shall receive; and in the book of
Proverbs, which speaks of him as
the True Wisdom, we read that
those who seek him early shall find
him.</p>

<p>Now, if Susan had not thought
about these things, and been led to
desire to do what was right, perhaps
she would have helped the
naughty boys in driving away the
sheep, instead of telling them, as
she had done, that it was wrong,
and following after their owner
when she found they would not do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
what was right. When we see others
do wrong, we should always try
to persuade them to leave their
evil ways; but if they will not listen
to us, then we should do all we
can to prevent them from succeeding.</p>

<p>The lamb soon grew very fond of
Susan, and followed her about every
where. If she was absent from home
longer than usual, it would lie down
before the cottage door, and watch
for her, and as soon as she returned,
it would frisk about and look
quite happy. It was just the same
with Susan’s companions, they were
always glad to see her, because she
was gentle and kind to them.</p>

<p>When I have seen little boys and
girls cross, and teazing each other,
I have sometimes wondered why
they could like to make others uncomfortable,
for I have always observed
that they did not look happy
themselves. But when I recollected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that the Bible tells us, that the
heart of man is naturally inclined
to do evil, I have not wondered any
longer at what I have seen. I then
thought how very sad it was, that
children did not love the Saviour,
for then they would have tried to be
like him, and would have been much
happier. I have longed to tell them
about Christ, and how pleasant it is
to know him, and to love him. Sometimes
when little boys and girls
have read “Janeway’s Token for
Children,” and other little books
which told them about children who
have loved Christ, they have desired
to be like them. Susan was like
these good children; and if a poor
man came to ask charity, she was
always glad if her mother could
spare any thing for him.</p>

<p>Remember, that the Saviour came
down from heaven to seek and to
save that which is lost; he died upon
the cross that we might be cleansed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
from our sins by his precious blood,
and he suffered for us, that we
might be sanctified or made holy by
the power and influence of his holy
Spirit, and thus be made the children
of God, and heirs of his kingdom.
My dear children, do you
love the Saviour? Do you wish to
be like him, kind, merciful, patient,
and “of great goodness?” Your little
hearts will tell you whether you
really desire this, and if you are
still strangers to him, pray that he
will by the power of his holy Spirit,
teach you to know him and to love
him. If you refuse to listen to these
things, and do not seek the Saviour,
you will be unhappy in this world,
and miserable in that which is to
come.</p>

<p>I have a little more to tell you
about Susan and her Lamb. Susan’s
mother spun its wool every year,
and if you had gone to the cottage
on a winter evening, you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
have seen her busy with her spinning-wheel,
while Susan and her
brothers were employed in other
works, and one of them read aloud
the Bible, or some useful book. After
the wool was spun, Susan knit
stockings for herself and her brothers,
which they found very warm
and comfortable in the winter. In
the course of a few years, the lamb
grew up and had several other little
lambs, so that in time Susan had
a flock of sheep, which were a great
help to the family. She was very
glad that she had gone to the Sunday
school, and had been taught
the texts, which made her wish to
be kind to the little lamb. I hope my
little readers will try to remember
all that they read in their Bibles,
remembering that the Bible tells us
the commands of God, and in keeping
his precepts there is great reward.</p>
